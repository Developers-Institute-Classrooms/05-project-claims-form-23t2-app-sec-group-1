      <h2 className="body-subheader">
        At enSURE we believe every person has the right to insurance that is
        easy to understand, will cover them for what they need, and is easily
        available when they need it.

        enSURE was born out of thi vision in 2017 by its co-founders Peter
        Westlock and Janine Brown. Peter brought over two decades of experience
        and a deep committment to customer satisfaction whilst at the helm
        steering the household name IGroup Insure. Janine worked across both the
        public and private health sectors and spearheading several health app
        rollouts before heading up the disruptive Kiwi startup CleverCover.
        Peter and Janine realised that by bringing together IGroup Insure and
        CleverCover, they would be able to to deliver best-in-industry outcomes
        and support for their customers.

        At enSURE we pride ourselves on the accessibility we are able to offer
        to each of our customers. Our central Auckland branch has acted as a
        great hub for us tobe able to connect with our customers face-to-face.
        In 2019, we were able to expand our Lower Hutt call centre to meet the
        increased demand for our growing services whilst maintaining a
        gold-standard of customer care.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite the disruptions of Covid-19 last year, enSURE rose to the
        challenge of supporting our customers in a digital-only environment with
        the launch of our 'booka-call' online video call service, and our
        chatbot service Ask Sarah.
        <br />
        <br />
        At enSURE we believe that good health and wellness begins on the ground
        at home and in the community. We have been proud to be able to give back
        to our customers and our community, as backers of the National Volunteer
        Emergency Vehicle Association and the Young Peoples Wellbeing Business
        Grant.
        <br />
        <br />
        We continue to work towards evolving the best care for our customers in

        to suit your individual circumstances. All of our staff are experienced
